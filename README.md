<strong>Sphinx Search Installation</strong><br/>
The default search engine for Elgg had been causing performance issues, we have had to swap it out with Sphinx Search<sup>[3](#fn3)</sup>.

Please follow instructions to install Sphinx Search on the server here https://github.com/tbs-sct/gcconnex/tree/gcconnex/mod/sphinx

<i>For better performance, we implemented Sphinx Search Delta Index (optional)</i>
