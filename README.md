<h1>GCconnex & How to Install</h1>
This project is forked from Elgg<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup> by the Federal Government of Canada. This branch contains the main version of Elgg for 1.8 which is currently being maintained.

All dependencies is included in this branch for Elgg v1.8, please note that some modules are included as submodules<sup>[2](#fn2)</sup>, you may need to pull from submodule.


```
git submodule foreach git pull origin master
```

<strong>Sphinx Search Installation</strong><br/>
The default search engine for Elgg had been causing performance issues, we have had to swap it out with Sphinx Search<sup>[3](#fn3)</sup>.

Please follow instructions to install Sphinx Search on the server here https://github.com/tbs-sct/gcconnex/tree/gcconnex/mod/sphinx

<i>For better performance, we implemented Sphinx Search Delta Index (optional)</i>
